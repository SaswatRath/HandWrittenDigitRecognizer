# HandWrittenDigitRecognizer
This project is a handwritten digit recognition application that uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify handwritten digits. It includes a drawing interface where users can draw a digit, and the model predicts the corresponding number with a confidence score.

## Features
Handwritten Digit Recognition: Recognizes handwritten digits (0-9) using the MNIST dataset.

Interactive Drawing Interface: A user-friendly interface built using Tkinter where users can draw digits.

Model Training and Loading: Automatically trains a new model if no saved model is found or loads an existing model.

Data Preprocessing: Scales and reshapes the MNIST dataset for training and prediction.

## Tech Stack
Python: Core programming language.

TensorFlow: For building and training the CNN model.

Tkinter: For the graphical user interface.

PIL (Pillow): For image processing and resizing.

NumPy: For numerical computations and data manipulation.
