# HandWrittenDigitRecognizer
A GUI-based Handwritten Digit Recognizer that predicts digits (0-9) drawn on a canvas using a CNN trained on the MNIST dataset. Built with TensorFlow and Tkinter, it loads a pre-trained model (`digit_recognizer_model.h5`) if available or trains a new one. Features include digit recognition, an interactive canvas, and model persistence.
