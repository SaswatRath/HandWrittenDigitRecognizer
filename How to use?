## 1. Install the required libraries:
Ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:
pip install tensorflow opencv-python pillow numpy

## 2. Run the script:
Execute the script using:
python handwritten_digit_recognizer.py

## 3. Train the model (if not already saved):
The script will train a CNN on the MNIST dataset if no pre-trained model (digit_recognizer_model.h5) is found. This model will then be saved for future use.

## 4. Use the GUI:
A window will appear where you can draw digits (0-9) on a black canvas.
Click "Predict" to see the recognized digit and confidence score displayed on the canvas.
Click "Clear" to reset the canvas for a new input.
